Submission for the CS 4780:  Intro to Machine Learning course during the Spring 2024 semester. 
This course is now known as CS 3780.

This version of the course and competition were offered through Professors Killian Weinberger and Karthik Sridharan. 
After learning about a various number of machine learning algorithms/models it was time to put our knowledge to the test with this competition. 

Throughout the span of this competition I was able to implement both the logisitic regression and SVM model that we were taught in the course. The rest of the models were ones I did research on my own in an attempt to achieve the best test accuracy. I began at 90%, and was able to bump it up to an improved 96.67% overall. The Python file provided should be ran through Google Colab or Jupyter to see the results of each model.

Below are the instructions and the rules provided for the competition:

Thank you to both professors for this project! I hope to work on more machine learning projects within the future!
